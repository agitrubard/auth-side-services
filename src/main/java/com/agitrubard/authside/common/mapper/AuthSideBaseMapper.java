/**
 * A generic interface for mapping objects of type {@code S} to objects of type {@code T}.
 * This interface provides two methods: one for mapping a single object and another for mapping a collection of objects.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should provide an implementation for the {@link #map(Object)} method that takes an
 * object of type {@code S} and returns an object of type {@code T}. The {@link #map(Collection)} method, which takes
 * a collection of objects of type {@code S}, should be implemented by calling the {@code map} method on each element
 * of the collection and returning a list of the resulting objects of type {@code T}.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide a generic way of mapping objects from one type to another, allowing for
 * reuse of code and reduction of duplication.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of the source object to be mapped
 * @param <T> the type of the target object to be mapped to
