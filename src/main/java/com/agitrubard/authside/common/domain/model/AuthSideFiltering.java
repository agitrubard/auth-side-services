 * An interface representing a filter used to narrow down a data set based on specific criteria.
 * Classes implementing this interface should define the criteria and the rules used to apply the filter.
 * The implementation can be as simple or complex as necessary, depending on the requirements of the use case.
 * For example, a filtering implementation could allow filtering by a range of dates, by text matching, or by
 * specific values of one or more properties of the objects being filtered.
